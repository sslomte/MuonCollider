Running Jobs on the Wisconsin Computing Cluster

If you don't have a grid certificate and are joining CMS, follow the instructions here:
https://www.hep.wisc.edu/cms/comp/accountSetup.html#grid_cert

If you don't have a grid certificate and are not joining CMS, you can join the GLOW Virtual Organization. Email help@hep.wisc.edu and ask for instructions.

Start with the scripts "mucoljob.sh" and "ilcsoft.sh", found in this directory. You may need to revise them for your task. 

Log into one the of login nodes: ssh login.hep.wisc.edu
Set up your files in /nfs_scratch in a directory under your user name. For example, my user name is "cvuosalo",
so I created my own directory under /nfs_scratch with "mkdir /nfs_scratch/cvuosalo".

Create a job submission directory (any name you choose) and put the scripts "mucoljob.sh" and "ilcsoft.sh" in it. Make sure
both scripts are executable:

chmod a+x mucoljob.sh ilcsoft.sh
ls -l mucoljob.sh ilcsoft.sh

Example output from ls -l:

-rwxrwxr-x 1 cvuosalo cvuosalo 375 Apr  1 11:22 ilcsoft.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 cvuosalo cvuosalo 133 Mar 17 21:48 mucoljob.sh

Note that executable files have x's in their permissions (-rwxrwxr-x). Files that run programs must be executable.


Create a voms proxy: voms-proxy-init -rfc  -valid 144:00

Submit your jobs to the cluster (change arguments for your needs):

python /usr/local/bin/runWiscJobs.py \
  --WorkFlow trymucol1 \
  --Executable=/nfs_scratch/cvuosalo/MuColl/runjobs/mucoljob.sh \
  --Arguments=10 \
  --nJobs=2 \
  --TransferInputFile=/nfs_scratch/cvuosalo/MuColl/runjobs/ilcsoft.sh \
  --OutputDir=testMuCol \
  --HDFSProdDir None \
  --Experiment mucol \
  --Requirements INFN_CVMFS_Exists
  
The "Workflow" argument should be a unique name that changes every time you submit jobs.
"Executable" should be the full path to your mucoljob.sh script.
"Arguments" are arguments passed to the mucoljob.sh script, which might not be needed by the script.
"nJobs" is the number of jobs to run on the cluster.
"TransferInputFile" should be the full path to your ilcsoft.sh script.

This command will give more information about the arguments to "runWiscJobs.py": python /usr/local/bin/runWiscJobs.py --help

You can check the progress of your jobs with this command: condor_q -nobatch

The logs from your jobs will be written to /nfs/scratch/<your user name>/<Workflow>. In the example submission command above <Workflow> is "trymucol1".
The output files from simulation and reconstruction will be written to the submission directory as files with names ending in ".out".
